<h2> About Punta Cana </h2>

<p> Punta Cana is a resort town within the Punta Cana-Bávaro-Veron-Macao municipal district, in the municipality of Higüey, in La Altagracia Province, the easternmost province of the Dominican Republic. The area has beaches and balnearios which face both the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, and it is a tourist destination. The weather is hot and humid, especially in late summer and autumn when the Northern Tropics receive their most direct sunlight. <p>

<h2> What I did there </h2>

<p> I played in the pool a lot at Punta Cana. There were 7 pools at the resort I was at in Punta Cana. I went to many resturaunts in Punta Cana. It was really fun there. <p>
